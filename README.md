# Homepage of the Climate Causality & Attribution Lab 

**Editors:** Marina Freidel, Frieder Loer, Fiona Spuler, Bjarne Biskamp

## Introduction  
This webpage is built using **Quarto**, a tool for creating scientific and technical websites, blogs, and reports. The site is hosted using **GitHub Pages**, allowing easy version control and collaboration.  

This document explains how to update and maintain the page.  

## What is Quarto?  
Quarto is an open-source publishing system that allows you to write content in **Markdown** and **Jupyter Notebooks** while integrating code execution (Python, R, etc.). It supports:  
- Reproducible research and scientific blogging  
- Easy styling and formatting using YAML and CSS  
- Dynamic content generation  

## How the Website is Structured  
The website consists of the following main files and directories:  

| Directory/File         | Description |
|------------------------|------------|
| `_site/`              | Output directory where the rendered website is stored. This is generated by Quarto and should not be manually edited. |
| `.quarto/`            | Stores Quarto-related configuration and cache files. |
| `images/`            | Contains image assets used throughout the website, including logos and people-related photos. |
| `people/`            | Section of the website dedicated to listing team members, with subdirectories for each individual. |
| `publications/`      | Contains publication-related pages. |
| `research/`          | Directory organizing the various research topics. |
| `tenders/`           | Contains information about available jobs and thesis opportunities. |
| `404.qmd`            | Quarto markdown file for handling "Page Not Found" (404) errors. |
| `custom_theme.scss`  | Custom styling file written in SCSS, used to define the website's appearance. |
| `dropdown.js`        | A JavaScript file for customized managing of dropdown menus on the website. |
| `impressum.qmd`      | Legal information page. |
| `index.qmd`          | The main homepage file of the website. |
| `index.css`          | The stylesheet for the main page of the website. |
| `logo.html`          | Activates the title image on the main page. |
| `progress-bar.html`  | HTML file for a scolling progress bar. |
| `README.md`          | Markdown file providing information about the project and website structure. |
| `theme.css`          | The main theme stylesheet defining the websiteâ€™s look and feel. |



## How to Make Changes  
### 1. **Clone the Repository**  
First, clone the repository to your local machine:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LIM-Climate-Causality/climate-causality.github.io.git
cd homepage
```

### 2. **Install Quarto**

Download and install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) on your machine.
If you are using VS Code you will also need the Quarto extension.

Check installation with:

```bash
quarto --version
``` 

### 3. **Edit Pages**

Modify the `.qmd` files using **Markdown**. Quarto also allows inline **HTML** sections which can be convenient for inserting images or creating custom elements.

Use **YAML** in the `_quarto.yml` file for website settings.

### 4. **Render the Website Locally**

**For checking changes during editing**

Run the following command in the repository folder:


```bash
quarto preview
```

or use the short cut:

<kbd>CRLT + Shift + K</kbd>

This will launch a local server where you can see live changes. However, *Preview* will only render the current page on which you are working at this time.

**Render the whole project evertytime before pushing changes**

Remember to render the whole project to make all modifications effective:

```bash
quarto render
```

This will create a directory `_site` which contains all the needed files for compiling the webpage.

### 5. **Commit and Push Changes**

Once you have made changes, commit and push them to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated webpage content"
git push origin main
```

### 6. **Deploy via GitHub Pages**

The webpage will be automatically deployed with every GitHub Action (pushing). Settings for the deployment can be foundin the repo under **Settings -> Pages**.
